# Fitness-Tracker

Fitness-Tracker is a web application catered to users who want to keep track of their weight loss/gain progress, nutrition plans, and workout plans all in one place.


=== User Stories ===

The landing page will provide users with a description of the application and prompt them to sign up or login if they have an account.

Once logged in, users will be directed to a dashboard where their weight can be inputed into a table with a dynamically updating graph to visualize the change. 

Users will be able to create, update, and delete their weight data when logged in to their account.

=== Stretch Goals ===

Users will be able to track workout plans from their Dashboard as well as use a nutrition calculator to keep track of calorie intake.
